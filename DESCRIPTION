Description: This R package implements methods for estimation and inference under Incomplete Block Designs and Balanced Incomplete Block Designs within a design-based finite-population framework. Based on 'Koo and Pashley' (2024) <arXiv:2405.19312>, it includes block-level estimators and extends to unit-level effects using 'Horvitz-Thompson' and 'HÃ¡jek' estimators. The package also provides asymptotic confidence intervals to support valid statistical inference.
